# 🧠 Hate Speech Detection – NLP-Powered Chrome Extension

**Hate Speech Detection** is an AI-driven Chrome Extension designed to identify and flag offensive or hateful content in real-time as users browse the web. This project combines cutting-edge **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques with a user-friendly browser tool to promote safer and more respectful digital spaces.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to combat online hate speech by leveraging machine learning and deep learning models integrated into a Chrome Extension. It enables users to detect and receive alerts about hate speech within any web content they are viewing.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔍 Real-time hate speech detection in web content
- 🧠 Powered by **GRU** and **LSTM** models trained on annotated hate speech datasets
- 🧩 Simple and intuitive Chrome Extension interface
- ⚙️ Local model inference for speed and privacy
- 🧪 Tested across multiple web platforms and media content

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** for model training and inference  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** for GRU and LSTM models  
- **JavaScript & HTML/CSS** for Chrome Extension frontend  
- **Flask** or **Node.js** (optional) for serving model as a backend API (if used)  
- **Chrome Developer Tools** for extension development and testing

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience in training NLP models using **GRU** and **LSTM** architectures.
- Integrated AI models into a real-world **Chrome Extension** to make ML results usable and accessible.
- Learned how to preprocess and clean text datasets for hate speech detection.
- Collaborated using version control, coordinated using task boards, and followed ethical considerations in AI.
- Understood limitations of hate speech detection and the importance of fairness and bias mitigation.

## 🔐 Ethical Considerations

This project was developed with the intention to promote respectful communication and not to censor or suppress freedom of speech. All datasets used were publicly available and processed with user privacy in mind.

---

## 📦 How to Use

1. Clone the repo and load the `/extension` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome.
2. (Optional) Start the local backend server to serve the trained model.
3. Open a webpage and activate the extension to scan for hate speech.

## ✅ Project Status

✔️ Completed as part of an **NLP semester project**  
✔️ Deployed as a working prototype Chrome Extension

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Improve model accuracy with larger, more diverse datasets  
- Implement multilingual hate speech detection  
- Optimize performance for low-resource environments  
- Add user reporting and feedback loop for model improvement
